SignalR-Reference
=================

A reference implementation of how I would build a SignalR app in a distributed/web farm environment

This is currently a *very* rough work in progress. 

My intention is to build a SignalR app that uses messaging principles end-to-end to allow for rapid development and scale-ablity.
